## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to evaluate your knowledge on API testing and Java by setting up a basic API Test Automation framework using Rest-Assured and Cucumber. You will need to create a test suite that executes a few tests against one or two endpoints of a hotel booking website and evaluates their responses.

## Background

The application under test is a simple hotel booking website where you can book a room and also send a form with a request. 
The website can be accessed at https://automationintesting.online/. 

The Swagger documentation for the two endpoints you will be testing can be found at:
- Booking endpoint: https://automationintesting.online/booking/swagger-ui/index.html
- Message endpoint: https://automationintesting.online/message/swagger-ui/index.html

## Task
Your task is to set up a basic API Test Automation framework from scratch using Java, Rest-Assured, and Cucumber. 
It is up to you to define the test cases. You don’t need to have a full coverage, but you need to show enough variation on the types of tests that you would need to write and execute and what to check.

There are 2 endpoints (booking and message). Feel free to select only 1 endpoint of choice, but be sure to cover enough type of tests.

## Requirements
- Use Java as the programming language
- Use Rest-Assured as the API testing library
- Use Cucumber as the BDD framework
- Design your codebase using a proper Java design pattern
- Write good tests with correct checks 
- Use Git for version control and push your codebase to an open GitHub repository
- Make regular commits to demonstrate your progress

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository containing your API Test Automation framework
- A comprehensive test suite covering the scenarios mentioned above
- A well-structured codebase with proper design patterns and comments
- Regular commits demonstrating your progress

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness and completeness of the test suite
- Quality of the codebase (design patterns, structure, code quality, …)
- Use of Rest-Assured and Cucumber features
- Commit history and progress demonstration
